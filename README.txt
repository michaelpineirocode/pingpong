One of the aspects of this project that we found difficult was the audio feature of html. Because audio was a feature that I had not done before, it was a learning curve to get comfortable with a whole new feature. 

Another new feature we had used was the javascript command getComputedStyle. To get the colors of the game to change based on the style, I had to use this feature to read the sty;e and alter the color based on that. This took me some time to do, as learning a new command always comes with it's challenges. 

Third, we had to include multiple game modes. When including multiple game modes, we have to consider how to add onto the base game to alter it enough to be a different mode, but similar enough to feel like it is the same game. 

Along with that, switching between modes also was difficult for us. As we allowed switching mid game, we needed to get our code to be able to reset and change game modes without causing issue or feeling choppy and rough.
